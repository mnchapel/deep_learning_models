LeNet, also called LeNet-5, is a simple convolutional neural network. LeNet-5 is the most popular LeNet network.

You can find the variants of the LeNet network on this [page]({{site.baseurl}}{% link _model_variants/lenet.md %}).

Network features:

- 5 layers (3 convolutional + 2 fully connected)

## Architecture

## Last Convolutional Layer

In some representations of the LeNet architecture, we can see that there are 2 convolutional layers and 3 fully connected layers. But in the paper [1] the authors explained that layer C5 (the last convolutional layer in the architecture representation on this web page) is convolutional and not fully connected because if the size of the input image is bigger with everything else kept constant, then the feature map dimension will be larger than 1x1.
