In 1989, LeCun et al. [1] presented a new architecture known as the convolutional neural network with ConvNet.

Network features:

- 4 layers (2 convolutional + 2 fully connected)
- use tanh as activation function

## Architecture

{% include model_architecture.html model='convnet' img_detailed='assets/img/convnet.svg' %}

## Parameters

| Layer | Activation Shape  | Filter Shape | Weights    | Biases | Parameters |
| ----- | ----------------- | ------------ | ---------- | ------ | ---------- |
| Input | 1x16x16           | -            | 0          | 0      | 0          |
| Conv1 | 12x8x8            | 5x5          | 300        | 12     | 312        |
| Conv2 | 12x4x4            | 5x5          | 3,600      | 12     | 3,612      |
| FC1   | 30x1x1            | -            | 5,760      | 30     | 5,790      |
| FC2   | 10x1x1            | -            | 300        | 10     | 310        |
| **Total** |               |              |            |        | **10,024**  |

See [2] for explanations about parameters calculations.

According to the authors [1], there are 9760 parameters ...
