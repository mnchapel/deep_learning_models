I am Marie-Neige Chapel, a postdoctoral researcher in computer vision. So far, my research has mainly focused on the use of classical statistical models for image analysis. I've built this website with the aim of learning about the major deep learning models and sharing my knowledge in a unified way on the subject.

If you find any errors in my diagrams or explanations, please let me know! This website is still under construction, so feel free to drop by again.

You can find my personal website [here](https://mnchapel.github.io/).
